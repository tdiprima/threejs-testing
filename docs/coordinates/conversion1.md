<span style="color:blue;">I loaded an image into a texture `let texture = loader.load(imageSource);` and then added it to a plane `let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide});`.  I have an array `polygonPositions` that contains the positions of `line.geometry`.</span>

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">Since we are drawing on an image, I want to convert the three.js positions to image positions.  How do I do that?</span>

To convert Three.js positions to image coordinates when drawing on a texture, you need to map the 3D coordinates (from your `polygonPositions`) to 2D coordinates on the image. This process typically involves several steps:

1. **Normalize 3D Coordinates**: Convert the 3D positions from world space to normalized device coordinates (NDC). In NDC, each axis ranges from -1 to 1.

2. **Convert NDC to Image Coordinates**: Map the normalized coordinates to the pixel coordinates of your image.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Normalize 3D Coordinates
Three.js uses a coordinate system where (0,0,0) is the center of the screen, and -1 to 1 range for x and y axes in NDC. The conversion can be achieved as follows:

```javascript
// Assuming polygonPositions is an array of THREE.Vector3
let normalizedPositions = polygonPositions.map(position => {
    // Convert world position to NDC
    let vector = position.clone();
    vector.project(camera); // Project to NDC using the camera

    return new THREE.Vector2(
        (vector.x + 1) / 2, // Map from [-1, 1] to [0, 1]
        (-vector.y + 1) / 2 // Map from [-1, 1] to [0, 1] and flip Y
    );
});
```

### Step 2: Convert NDC to Image Coordinates
Once you have the normalized positions, you can convert them to image pixel coordinates:

```javascript
// Assuming imageSize is an object with width and height properties
normalizedPositions.forEach(normalizedPosition => {
    normalizedPosition.x *= imageSize.width; // Map x to image width
    normalizedPosition.y *= imageSize.height; // Map y to image height
});
```

### Putting It All Together
```javascript
let imageSize = { width: YOUR_IMAGE_WIDTH, height: YOUR_IMAGE_HEIGHT };

let imagePositions = polygonPositions.map(position => {
    let vector = position.clone();
    vector.project(camera);

    let normalized = new THREE.Vector2(
        (vector.x + 1) / 2,
        (-vector.y + 1) / 2
    );

    return {
        x: normalized.x * imageSize.width,
        y: normalized.y * imageSize.height
    };
});
```

This will give you an array of objects with `x` and `y` properties corresponding to the pixel positions on the image. Make sure `YOUR_IMAGE_WIDTH` and `YOUR_IMAGE_HEIGHT` are set to the actual dimensions of your image.

Note: The accuracy of this conversion depends on several factors like the camera's position, the plane's orientation and scale, and the precision of the original 3D coordinates. It's essential to consider these factors for an accurate mapping.

## Err0r

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">It says position.clone is not a function</span>

If you're getting an error saying `position.clone is not a function`, it's likely that the items in your `polygonPositions` array are not `THREE.Vector3` objects but perhaps a different type of object or raw data. To address this, let's first verify the format of the `polygonPositions` and then adapt the code accordingly.

### Step 1: Verify the Format of polygonPositions

You need to check what exactly is stored in `polygonPositions`. If these are not `THREE.Vector3` objects, you need to know their format to proceed. They might be arrays `[x, y, z]`, objects `{x: ..., y: ..., z: ...}`, or something else.

### Step 2: Adapt the Code

Based on the format of your `polygonPositions`, you'll need to adjust the code. I'll provide examples for a couple of common formats:

If `polygonPositions` Contains Arrays `[x, y, z]`:

```javascript
let imagePositions = polygonPositions.map(posArray => {
    let vector = new THREE.Vector3().fromArray(posArray); // Create a Vector3 from the array
    vector.project(camera);

    return {
        x: ((vector.x + 1) / 2) * imageSize.width,
        y: ((-vector.y + 1) / 2) * imageSize.height
    };
});
```

If `polygonPositions` Contains Objects `{x: ..., y: ..., z: ...}`:

```javascript
let imagePositions = polygonPositions.map(posObj => {
    let vector = new THREE.Vector3(posObj.x, posObj.y, posObj.z);
    vector.project(camera);

    return {
        x: ((vector.x + 1) / 2) * imageSize.width,
        y: ((-vector.y + 1) / 2) * imageSize.height
    };
});
```

### Notes
- If `polygonPositions` is in a different format than those mentioned above, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly to correctly create a `THREE.Vector3` object from your data.
- Ensure that `camera`, `imageSize.width`, and `imageSize.height` are correctly defined and accessible in the context where this code is executed.
- The projection step (`vector.project(camera)`) assumes that the positions in `polygonPositions` are in the same coordinate space as the camera (usually the world space in a Three.js scene). If they are in a different space (e.g., local space of a specific object), additional transformations might be necessary.
