## Convert 3D to Image Coordinates

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have three.js code that allows the user to draw on an image.  On mouseup, I need to log the image coordinates of the THREE.line that has been drawn...</span>

In your Three.js code, you've set up a basic drawing system where users can draw lines on an image. To log the image coordinates of the `THREE.Line` that has been drawn on `mouseup`, you are already storing the positions in `polygonPositions`. However, these positions are in the world coordinate system of Three.js, not the image coordinates.

```js
let line = new THREE.Line(new THREE.BufferGeometry(), new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ "#0000ff" }));

if (intersects.length > 0) {
  let point = intersects[0].point;
  currentPolygonPositions.push(point.x, point.y, point.z);
  line.geometry.setAttribute("position", new THREE.Float32BufferAttribute(currentPolygonPositions, 3));
}
```

To convert these world coordinates to image coordinates, you'll need to understand the relationship between your 3D world and the 2D image. The conversion depends on how the image is mapped to the 3D geometry. In your case, it appears you're using a `THREE.PlaneGeometry` with the image texture applied.

```js
// Set up geometry to raycast against
let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10);
let texture = new THREE.TextureLoader("/images/image1.jpg");
let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMat);
scene.add(plane);
```

Here's a general approach to convert the 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates:

1. **Normalize the World Coordinates**: Since your plane geometry might not exactly match the dimensions of your image, first normalize the 3D coordinates to the plane's scale.

2. **Convert to Image Coordinates**: After normalization, map these coordinates to the actual pixel coordinates of the image.

Here's a function you can add to your code to handle this conversion:

```javascript
function convertToImageCoordinates(worldCoordinates, planeWidth, planeHeight, imageWidth, imageHeight) {
    // Normalize the 3D coordinates to the plane's scale
    const normalizedX = (worldCoordinates.x / planeWidth) + 0.5; // Assuming plane is centered
    const normalizedY = (worldCoordinates.y / planeHeight) + 0.5; // Assuming plane is centered

    // Convert to image coordinates
    const imageX = Math.round(normalizedX * imageWidth);
    const imageY = Math.round((1 - normalizedY) * imageHeight); // Flip Y-axis

    return { x: imageX, y: imageY };
}
```

Now, you need to call this function for each point in your `polygonPositions` array in the `onMouseUp` function. You will also need to know the actual dimensions of your plane (`planeWidth` and `planeHeight`) and the dimensions of your image (`imageWidth` and `imageHeight`). Here's how you can modify the `onMouseUp` function:

```javascript
function onMouseUp() {
    if (isDrawing) {
        mouseIsPressed = false;
        // ... existing code ...

        // Convert and log image coordinates
        const imageCoordinates = polygonPositions.map(pos => {
            const worldPoint = new THREE.Vector3(pos[0], pos[1], pos[2]);
            return convertToImageCoordinates(worldPoint, planeGeom.parameters.width, planeGeom.parameters.height, /* imageWidth */, /* imageHeight */);
        });

        console.log("Image Coordinates: ", imageCoordinates);
    }
}
```

Remember to replace `/* imageWidth */` and `/* imageHeight */` with the actual dimensions of your image. This approach assumes that the plane is centered at the origin and its size matches the aspect ratio of the image. If your setup is different, you might need to adjust the normalization step accordingly.

## Scale PlaneGeometry to Image

To scale the `THREE.PlaneGeometry` to match the size of an image, you need to adjust the dimensions of the geometry to match the aspect ratio of the image. In your case, the image `image1.jpg` is 1024x768 pixels, so you should maintain this aspect ratio.

The `THREE.PlaneGeometry` constructor takes two parameters to define its width and height. Since your image has a width of 1024 pixels and a height of 768 pixels, you'll want to use these proportions. However, these values might be too large for your scene, so it's common to scale them down while keeping the aspect ratio the same.

For example, if you want to scale it down by a factor of 100, you would use 10.24 for the width and 7.68 for the height. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
let aspectRatio = 1024 / 768;
let planeWidth = 10; // You can adjust this value as needed
let planeHeight = planeWidth / aspectRatio;

let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(planeWidth, planeHeight);
let texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load("/images/image1.jpg");
let planeMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMat);
scene.add(plane);
```

This code will create a plane that has the same aspect ratio as your image. Adjust `planeWidth` to scale the size of the plane according to your needs. Remember that the aspect ratio should always be maintained to avoid any distortion of the image.
