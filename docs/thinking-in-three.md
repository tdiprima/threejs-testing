## Thinking in Three.js

Transitioning from 2D to 3D programming can be challenging. Here are some resources that might help you think in 3D:

1. "Learning Three.js: The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL" by Jos Dirksen: This book is a great resource for learning Three.js. It covers everything from the basics of 3D programming to advanced topics such as lighting, shadows, and animations.

2. Three.js documentation: The official documentation for Three.js is a great resource for learning how to use the library. It includes tutorials, examples, and API documentation.

3. Three.js Fundamentals: This is a series of tutorials on the Three.js website that cover the basics of 3D programming and using Three.js.

4. Online courses: There are many online courses available that teach 3D programming with Three.js. Some popular options include "Three.js Essential Training" on LinkedIn Learning and "Interactive 3D Graphics" on Udacity.

5. Practice: Finally, practice is key to becoming comfortable with 3D programming. Try creating simple projects with Three.js, experiment with different techniques and features, and challenge yourself to create increasingly complex projects.
