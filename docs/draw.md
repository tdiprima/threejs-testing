[Buffergeometry - How to Morph 3D Objects](https://youtu.be/ZYi0xGp882I)

Every mesh in three.js has a geometry and a material.

**material** => how the surface of the object is **shaded**

**geometry** => the shape (point locations; x,y coordinates)

**buffer geometry** attributes:

- vertex positions
- [uv](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-uv/)'s
- [normal](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/06/08/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-normals/) vectors
