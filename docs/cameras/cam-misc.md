# Set up camera

```js
// Camera defines the field of view
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
  55, // fov angle (in degrees)
  window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, // aspect ratio
  0.1, // near plane
  1000 // far plane
);
```

# Camera size

[Why is **aspect** a property of both the **camera** *and* size of the **renderer**?](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/why-is-aspect-a-property-of-the-camera-and-size-of-the-renderer/13870)

`WebGLRenderer.setSize()` just defines the **resolution of the canvas** (by taking into account the pixel ratio).

When rendering with a perspective camera, it's recommended that its **aspect ratio** should always be **updated** as soon as the canvas is resized.

Otherwise the final image is distorted. Because the aspect ratio of the camera does not match the one of the canvas. Hence, always **do this when resizing:**

```js
camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
camera.updateProjectionMatrix();

renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
```

# Camera position

[Camera position in Three JS](https://youtu.be/lSkC-EeStyQ)

```js
x = width / left and right // horizontal movement
y = height / top and bottom // vertical movement
z = depth / zoom (in or out)
```

# What is the purpose of glScissor?

[gamedev.stackexchange.com](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/40704/what-is-the-purpose-of-glscissor)

You almost always want to set the **scissor rectangle** to the same values as the **viewport**.

You use `glViewport()` to determine the **location** and **size** of the screen space **viewport** region.

> **screenspace** = The space available on a screen display.
> **`glViewport`** maps the projection coordinates to device coordinates, but does not clip.

That's where **scissor** in comes in. `glScissor()` defines a screen space rectangle **beyond which nothing is drawn**. Scissor test enabled.

The scissor rectangle can be used to **temporarily restrict drawing to a sub-rectangle** of the viewport, for special effects, UI elements, etc.

## [Controls.target vs camera.lookAt](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/controls-target-vs-camera-lookat/5086/6)

I used `camera.lookAt()` to set direction in which camera looks.

Reading on OrbitControls, I learned that `camera.lookAt()` should be replaced by<br>
`controls.target`.

What's the difference?

OrbitControls internally uses `Object3D.lookAt()` in order to look at the defined<br>
target location of focus (`OrbitControls.target`).

> When I use it, panning becomes an issue.<br>
> Target object doesn't pan with rest of the scene,<br>
> and is static while panning.<br>

That's the intended behavior since panning transforms the `OrbitControls.target` vector.<br>
Or in other words, the location of focus.

You also have to call `controls.update()` after changing the target.

OrbitControls ensures that the camera orbits (rotates) around the target.<br>
Rotation and zooming also happens with focus on target. (Focused on the defined target vector.)
