## Camera Orientation in three.js

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Do you specifically need to say "camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0))", or is that redundant (I'm assuming the camera automatically looks at 0, 0, 0)?</span>

```js
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0));
```

In three.js, setting `camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0))` is not always necessary, as the **camera does not automatically look at the origin** (0, 0, 0) by default. 

The purpose of `camera.lookAt()` is to orient the camera so that it is pointing towards a specific position in the scene. By passing a `THREE.Vector3` representing the target position as an argument to `lookAt()`, you can <mark>**make the camera focus on that point.**</mark>

If you omit the `camera.lookAt()` call, the camera's initial orientation will depend on how it was created. For example, if you create a camera using `new THREE.PerspectiveCamera()`, it will be ***positioned* at the origin** by default, but it will not be automatically **looking at** the origin. Instead, it will be pointing along the negative z-axis by default.

So, if you want the camera to look at a specific point or have a desired initial orientation, you should include the `camera.lookAt()` statement to achieve the desired result.
