## Quaternion (think "Rotation")

Sure thing! A quaternion is a mathematical concept that extends the idea of vectors and complex numbers into a four-dimensional space.

Just like how a vector has magnitude (size) and direction, and a complex number has a real part and an imaginary part, a quaternion has four parts: a real part and three imaginary parts.

Quaternions are really useful in computer graphics and animation, because they allow us to represent rotations in 3D space more efficiently than other methods. They're also used in physics simulations and other applications where it's important to keep track of an object's orientation and position over time.

While quaternions might seem like a pretty advanced mathematical concept, they're actually based on some of the same ideas you might have learned about in algebra and geometry, like complex numbers and vectors.

## Complex Number

Sure! A complex number is a number that has two parts: a real part and an imaginary part. The imaginary part is a multiple of the square root of -1, which is denoted by the letter i.

So, a complex number can be written in the form a + bi, where a is the real part and bi is the imaginary part. For example, 3 + 2i is a complex number, where 3 is the real part and 2i is the imaginary part.

Complex numbers are really useful in math and science because they allow us to solve certain types of equations that we wouldn't be able to solve with just real numbers. They're also used in electrical engineering and other fields where it's important to understand how waves and signals behave.

For example, if you're studying the behavior of an electrical circuit, you might use complex numbers to represent the voltage and current in the circuit.

## visual representation of a quaternion

A good visual representation of a quaternion can be thought of as a combination of a vector and a scalar.

Imagine you have a 3D vector that represents a direction in space. You can also think of this vector as a point on a sphere, where the center of the sphere represents the origin of the vector.

Now, imagine that you have a scalar quantity that represents a rotation around that vector. You can think of this scalar as an angle of rotation, where positive angles represent counterclockwise rotation and negative angles represent clockwise rotation.

Together, the vector and the scalar combine to form a quaternion, which represents both the direction of the vector and the amount of rotation around that vector.

One way to visualize a quaternion is to imagine a spinning object in 3D space. The direction of the object's axis of rotation is represented by the vector part of the quaternion, and the speed and direction of the rotation are represented by the scalar part.

While quaternions can be a bit tricky to visualize, they're really useful in computer graphics and animation because they allow us to represent complex rotations and movements in 3D space with a single mathematical object.

## Yaw, Pitch, Roll

Yaw, pitch, and roll are types of rotations that describe the orientation of an object in three-dimensional space.

Yaw refers to a rotation around the vertical axis (also known as the yaw axis), which is usually defined as pointing straight up. This is like turning your head left or right while keeping it level.

Pitch refers to a rotation around the horizontal axis (also known as the pitch axis), which is perpendicular to the yaw axis. This is like tilting your head up or down while keeping it level.

Roll refers to a rotation around the lateral axis (also known as the roll axis), which is perpendicular to both the yaw and pitch axes. This is like tilting your head to one side while keeping it level.

Together, these three types of rotations allow us to describe the orientation of an object in 3D space with respect to a fixed reference frame. They're used in many fields, including aviation, robotics, and computer graphics, to describe the movements and orientations of objects.
