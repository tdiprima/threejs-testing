## Level of Detail (LOD)

<span style="color:#59acf3;font-size:larger;">level-of-detail.html</span>

The LOD function is used to create a Level of Detail object, which allows you to **switch between** different models or geometries **based on the distance** between the camera and the object.

This is particularly useful for **optimizing the performance** of your 3D scenes by reducing the level of detail when objects are far away.

### Example:

```javascript
// Create a Level of Detail object
var lod = new THREE.LOD();

// Create different levels of detail (meshes or geometries)
var highDetailGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(10, 32, 32);
var highDetailMesh = new THREE.Mesh(highDetailGeometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 }));

var mediumDetailGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(10, 16, 16);
var mediumDetailMesh = new THREE.Mesh(mediumDetailGeometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }));

var lowDetailGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(10, 8, 8);
var lowDetailMesh = new THREE.Mesh(lowDetailGeometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff }));

// Add the different levels of detail to the LOD object
lod.addLevel(highDetailMesh, 0); // Distance = 0 or closer
lod.addLevel(mediumDetailMesh, 100); // Distance between 0 and 100
lod.addLevel(lowDetailMesh, 200); // Distance between 100 and 200

// Add the LOD object to the scene
scene.add(lod);
```

In this example, we create three different levels of detail for a sphere object.

The `highDetailMesh` represents the highest level of detail, with a high number of vertices. The `mediumDetailMesh` and `lowDetailMesh` have progressively lower levels of detail with fewer vertices.

We then use the `lod.addLevel()` method to add each level of detail to the LOD object. The first parameter is the mesh or geometry representing the level of detail, and the second parameter is the distance at which this level of detail should be used.

Finally, we add the LOD object to the scene using `scene.add(lod)`.

When rendering the scene, three.js will automatically switch between the different levels of detail based on the distance between the camera and the LOD object. This helps optimize the performance of the scene by rendering simpler geometries when they are far away and more detailed geometries when they are closer to the camera.
