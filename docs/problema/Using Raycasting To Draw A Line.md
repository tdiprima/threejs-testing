## Using Raycasting to Draw a Line

<!-- can you write a three.js script that uses raycasting to collect a series of mouse coordinates into a vector on mouse move, then on mouseup, draw a line on the screen, using those mouse coordinates? -->

// Set up the scene and camera
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

    // Remove the mouse event listeners
    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove);
    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp);

    // Draw the final line
    line.geometry.setDrawRange(0, positions.length / 3);

// Render the scene

When the user **moves the mouse**, the script uses the raycaster to get the intersection point with the scene, and adds that point to an array of positions and colors for the line.

When the user **releases the mouse** button, the script removes the mouse event listeners, and draws the final line, using the position and color arrays.

### intersects.length > 0 never executes.  What is wrong? üòë

<mark>**Because there needs to be an object there to intersect with. The End.**</mark>

If `intersects.length > 0` is not executing, it's likely because the raycasting is not working properly.

1. Make sure the objects in your scene have their `geometry` property set. The `intersectObjects` method uses the `geometry` property of objects to calculate intersections. If the objects don't have a `geometry`, the raycasting won't work.

2. Make sure the raycaster is set up correctly. The raycaster needs to be created with the correct parameters, including the **position** and **direction** of the **ray**.
    * In the example, the raycaster is set up to use the **normalized** device coordinates of the **mouse** position and the **camera's** position and direction.
    * If your setup is different, make sure you adjust the raycaster parameters accordingly.

3. Make sure the mouse coordinates are being **calculated** correctly.
    * In the example, the `mousemove` event listener *calculates* the normalized device coordinates of the mouse position.
    * Make sure your code is doing something similar.

### Includes some additional debugging information:

```js
const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);console.log(intersects);if (intersects.length > 0) {    console.log('Intersected!');
    //...
}

//...

function onMouseUp() {    // Remove the mouse event listeners    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', onMouseUp, false);    // Update the line material to show the colors    material.vertexColors = THREE.VertexColors;    // Tell the renderer to render the scene    renderer.render(scene, camera);}```

### What the fluff?

`intersects` is an empty array.  Is the parameter `scene.children` correct, when calling `intersectObjects`?

<mark>It's possible that the `scene.children` array **doesn't contain the objects you're trying to raycast against,** which would result in an empty intersects array.</mark>

When calling `intersectObjects`, the first argument should be an array of objects that you want to test for intersection.

If you're not getting any intersections, it's possible that you're not passing the correct array of objects to the function.

### Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the objects you want to test for intersection are added to the scene using `scene.add(object)` **before** calling `intersectObjects`.

2. If your scene has nested objects, you can set the **second argument** of `intersectObjects` to `true` to test for intersection with **child objects** as well.
   * `raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true)`

3. If you're still not getting any intersections, you can try **logging** the `scene.children` array to the console to make sure that it contains the objects you're expecting.
    * You can also **log** the `intersects` array to see if any intersections are being detected at all. This can help you narrow down the issue.

## There are no objects.

I have no objects to intersect with.  Instead of calling `intersectObjects`, is there a function that does an **intersect** simply with the **screen coordinates?**

Yes... <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">(No!)</span>

You can use the **`unproject`** method of the **camera**

to **convert the mouse coordinates** into a 3D point in the scene

and then **perform your own intersection test against that point.**

```js
// function onMouseUp()
// Use the camera to unproject the mouse coordinates into the scene
const point = new THREE.Vector3(mouse.x, mouse.y, 0);
point.unproject(camera);

// Perform your own intersection test against the unprojected point
// In this example, we're just testing against a plane at z=0
const direction = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);
const ray = new THREE.Raycaster(point, direction);

const intersection = ray.intersectPlane(new THREE.Plane(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1)));

if (intersection) {
    positions.push(intersection.point.x, intersection.point.y, intersection.point.z);
    color.setHex(Math.random() * 0xffffff);
    colors.push(color.r, color.g, color.b);
    line.geometry.setAttribute('position', new THREE.Float32BufferAttribute(positions, 3));
    line.geometry.setAttribute('color', new THREE.Float32BufferAttribute(colors, 3));
}
```

<br>
In this modified version of the script, the **`unproject`** method of the **camera** is used to convert the mouse coordinates into a 3D point in the scene.


### ray.intersectPlane is not a function

Are you sure intersectPlane is being used on the correct object?

My apologies, you are correct.

The **`intersectPlane`** method is actually part of the **THREE.Plane** object, not the THREE.Raycaster object.

<span style="color: blue;font-weight:bold">And yet, you're doing it again anyway.</span>

```js
const plane = new THREE.Plane(new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 1), 0);
const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster(camera.position, point.sub(camera.position).normalize());
const intersection = raycaster.intersectPlane(plane);
```

<br>

**`THREE.Plane`** object that represents a plane at **`z=0`**

**Pass that object** to the `intersectPlane` method of the `THREE...`
