## Task:

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Write three.js code that loads an image, and allows the user to change the pixel colors on the fly.</span>

Here is an example three.js code that loads an image and allows the user to change the pixel colors on the fly using the mouse. (Well, okay...)

In this code, we first set up the scene, camera and renderer. We then load the image texture using the `TextureLoader`. We create a plane geometry and a mesh with the material containing the image texture, and add the mesh to the scene. We then handle the mouse move event to get the mouse position in the scene and use a `Raycaster` to find the intersected face of the mesh. We then extract the pixel color at the UV coordinate of the face using a canvas, modify the color, and update the pixel color using the `toDataURL()` method. Finally, we render the scene in an animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame()`.

## Nothing happens when I click on the image.

The `mousemove` event should trigger the function that changes the pixel colors in response to mouse movement.

Here's a solution that might work:

In this version, we add the `mousemove` event listener to the mesh object itself. When a `mousemove` event is detected on the mesh, the function that changes the pixel colors is called.

I hope this version works better for you.

```js
// Handle mouse move event to change pixel colors
mesh.on("mousemove", event => {
  let uv = event.uv; // event.uv this time
});
```

## What version?

"mesh.on is not a function".

OK, here's an updated solution that uses the current syntax.

In this version, we add event listeners to the mesh object for ``mousedown``, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events. When the `mousedown` event is detected on the mesh, the function that gets the pixel data and sets the color is called. When the `mousemove` event is detected on the mesh and the mouse button is down, the function that changes the pixel colors is called. When the `mouseup` event is detected on the mesh, the `mousedown` flag is set to false.

I hope this updated solution works better for you.

## Raycasting change in three.js

<span style="color:#0000dd;">When was the "intersects[0].face" property with a "uv" property available?</span>

Probably in earlier versions of three.js, particularly before the major update to version 0.125.0. Starting from three.js version 0.125.0, the library underwent significant changes.

<mark>**The face-based raycasting approach was deprecated in favor of the newer geometry-based raycasting.**</mark>

With the introduction of the new raycasting system, the `intersects[0].face` property was replaced with `intersects[0].faceIndex`, and the "uv" information is obtained from the associated geometry.

If you are using a more recent version, you would need to modify your code to utilize the new raycasting system and **retrieve the UV coordinates from the geometry.**

<span style="color:#0000dd;">BTW I went all the way back to 70, and it's not there.  Same goes for mesh.on()</span>

```js
if (intersects.length > 0) {
  let face = intersects[0].face;
  let uv = face.uv; // undefined
  console.log(face);
}
```
