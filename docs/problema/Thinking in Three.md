## Thinking in Three.js

regarding three.js, i find it difficult to think in 3D, coming from 2D coding.  is there a book or anything to help me think in 3d?

Yes, transitioning from 2D to 3D programming can be challenging. Here are some resources that might help you think in 3D and get started with Three.js:

1. "Learning Three.js: The JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL" by Jos Dirksen: This book is a great resource for learning Three.js. It covers everything from the basics of 3D programming to advanced topics such as lighting, shadows, and animations.

2. Three.js documentation: The official documentation for Three.js is a great resource for learning how to use the library. It includes tutorials, examples, and API documentation.

3. Three.js Fundamentals: This is a series of tutorials on the Three.js website that cover the basics of 3D programming and using Three.js.

4. Online courses: There are many online courses available that teach 3D programming with Three.js. Some popular options include "Three.js Essential Training" on LinkedIn Learning and "Interactive 3D Graphics" on Udacity.

5. Practice: Finally, practice is key to becoming comfortable with 3D programming. Try creating simple projects with Three.js, experiment with different techniques and features, and challenge yourself to create increasingly complex projects.

I hope these resources help you get started with Three.js and develop your 3D programming skills. Good luck!
