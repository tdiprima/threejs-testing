# I like these kinds of things explained visually.

In OpenGL we have 2D coordinates that go from -1 to +1 for both the X and Y axis.

Then this image needs to be mapped to window coordinates.

```js
let container = document.getElementById( "container" );
let containerWidth = container.clientWidth;
let containerHeight = container.clientHeight;

mouseVector.x = 2 * (e.clientX / containerWidth) - 1;
mouseVector.y = 1 - 2 * ( e.clientY / containerHeight );

// otherwise, it's window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight
```

They convert the mouse coordinates, which go from 0 to containerWidth, and from 0 to containerHeight, to (-1, 1) in both axes.

Did you notice that the calculations for the y coordinate are negated? That's because in the classic DOM coordinate system, the Y axis grows from top to bottom (i.e. top is 0), whereas in 3D it grows from bottom to top (i.e. **bottom is 0**).
