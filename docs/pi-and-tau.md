## Circle Radians vs. Circumference

The formula 2&pi;r and the fact that there are 2&pi; radians in a full circle are related but represent different concepts.

### 2&pi; Radians in a Circle
When you say there are 2&pi; radians in a full circle, you are talking about the measure of the angle that subtends the entire circle. One radian is defined as the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length is equal to the radius of the circle. A full circle's angle subtends 2&pi; radians because it corresponds to an arc length that is 2&pi;r, or a full circle's worth of arc.

### 2&pi;r
The formula 2&pi;r represents the circumference of a circle. This formula tells you the distance around the circle if you were to travel along its edge. The "r" in 2&pi;r stands for the radius of the circle.

### Connection
So, while 2&pi;r calculates the length around the circle (i.e., its circumference), 2&pi; radians gives you the angular measure that corresponds to that same length when you're talking about the angle that subtends a full circle at its center.

In short, the 2&pi; part is common to both because it is a fundamental relationship in circles‚Äîwhether you are considering it in the context of an angular measure (2&pi; radians for a full circle) or a length measure (2&pi;r for the circumference).

## Say what??

Imagine you have a circle. The distance all the way around that circle is what we call the "circumference." The formula 2&pi;r helps you find this distance. Here, *r* is the **radius**, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the edge.

Now, let's talk about angles. If you've learned about degrees, you probably know that a full circle is 360 degrees. But there's another way to measure angles called "radians." In **radians**, a full circle is 2&pi; instead of 360 degrees.

So, these two things‚Äî2&pi;r and 2&pi; radians‚Äîare kind of cousins. The first one (2&pi;r) tells you how long the edge of the circle is. The second one (2&pi; radians) tells you how "wide" the angle is if you go all the way around the circle.

They both have 2&pi; because circles have this special relationship with the number &pi;. It's like a secret code that helps us understand circles better!

## Vitruvian Man

The "Vitruvian Man" is a famous drawing by Leonardo da Vinci. This drawing shows a man in both a square and a circle. It's named after a Roman architect named Vitruvius, who had ideas about the proportions of the human body. Leonardo's drawing was meant to show how the human body fits into both a circle and a square, suggesting that the human form embodies perfect proportions.

The drawing has been used in discussions of both art and science because it's a great example of how geometry and the study of the human body can intersect. It's often cited as a representation of the blend of art and science during the Renaissance period, and it's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most recognized works.

## What makes Math.PI so important for rotations?

**[why?](https://scriptinghelpers.org/questions/16244/what-makes-mathpi-so-important-for-rotations-etc)**

Math (and consequently, computers) doesn't use degrees for measuring angle.

While degrees are relatively useful for humans to understand angle, they are inelegant mathematically.

Mathematics uses the unit of **radians** for the measurement of a circle.

There are:

Two pi radians in a full circle. 2&pi;r

In other words:

360 degrees is 2pi radians

180 degrees is pi radians

etc.

**Imagine the unit circle, radius 1.**

In radians, the length of the arc moving around the circle is the same as the angle:

```math
C = pi * D = pi * 2r
```

Radians make `cos` and `sin` nicer to work with (mathematically), especially in calculus.

In JavaScript, `Math.cos()`, `Math.sin()`, `Math.tan()`, `Math.asin()`, etc, all use radians instead of degrees.

# Math is Fun

[Full Rotation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/full-rotation.html)

This image of a protractor shows that a **full rotation is 360¬∞**.

And **Half a rotation is 180¬∞**, called a Straight Angle.

And **Quarter of a rotation is 90¬∞**, called a Right Angle.

A full rotation is also equal to **2œÄ Radians**, so here are some equivalent values:
