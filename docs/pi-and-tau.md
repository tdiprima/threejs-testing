```text
C = 2 π r
Tau = 2 π
So...
C = 𝛕r
circumference = tau * r
```

```js
// The number π is a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
const pi = Math.PI;

// 2pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius.
// the circle constant to represent a full rotation around a circle in radians
// The value of τ is approximately 6.283 and can be calculated by dividing any circle's circumference by its radius.
const tau = pi * 2;
```

*As it turns out, they're saying that pi is "wrong", and so is tau.*
