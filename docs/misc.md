## Geometry parameters

```js
// "Cube" or "Frinkahedron", named after its discoverer. ;)
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(
  1, // width
  1, // height
  1 // Depth; that is, the length of the edges parallel to the Z axis.
);

const geometry2 = new THREE.CircleGeometry(
  1, // Radius of the circle
  100 // Number of segments
);
```

> Can three.js do 2D?

JS IS STRUCTURED IN AN ACCESSIBLE WAY. The way that Three.js structures its rendering means that the learning curve won't be too steep. It organizes all of the renders you'll do, whether 3D or 2D, under a "Scene" container.
