## Octree Collisions Explained

Imagine you're playing a video game or working with 3D graphics, and you have a bunch of objects in your virtual world. Octree collisions are a way to figure out if those objects are bumping into each other or overlapping.

Now, instead of thinking about these objects as complex 3D shapes, you can break down the space around you into smaller and smaller cubes, kind of like dividing a big LEGO block into smaller pieces. Each cube is called a "octree node."

At first, you have one big cube that represents your entire world. This big cube contains everything in your virtual world. Then, you might notice that some parts of this cube are empty, while others have objects in them. So, you divide the big cube into eight smaller cubes (hence the name "octree" because "oct" means eight). These eight smaller cubes are like the smaller pieces of the big LEGO block.

Now, you check each of these smaller cubes to see if they have any objects in them. If a cube doesn't have any objects, you can skip checking it. But if a cube has objects inside, you might need to divide it into even smaller cubes and keep checking until you find the smallest cubes possible or until you're sure there are no objects in them.

This process of breaking down the space into smaller cubes and checking for objects helps you figure out if objects are close to each other or even touching. If two objects are in the same or neighboring cubes, it's a clue that they might be colliding or overlapping. You can then use more precise calculations to see if they're actually colliding.

Octree collisions are a smart way to save time and computer resources because you don't have to check every object against every other object in your virtual world. Instead, you only check the cubes that might contain objects that are close to each other. This makes 3D graphics and physics simulations in games run faster and smoother!

## Raycasting

<span style="color:blue;">Is this how raycasting works in three.js?  I mean, the underlying thing that makes raycasting work?</span>

Raycasting in three.js, or in many other 3D graphics libraries and engines, doesn't directly use octrees by default, but the underlying principle is similar in the sense that it's all about efficiently finding intersections in a 3D scene. However, the specific algorithms and data structures used can vary.

In three.js, raycasting is typically implemented using a technique called a "bounding volume hierarchy" (BVH) or other acceleration structures like a spatial partitioning grid or an octree, depending on the specific needs and setup of your scene.

Here's a simplified explanation of how raycasting works in three.js:

1. **Creating a Ray:** You start by defining a ray. A ray is like an imaginary line with a starting point (origin) and a direction. You can think of it as shooting a laser beam into your 3D scene.

2. **Traversing the Scene:** The ray is then cast into the 3D scene. It starts from a specific point (usually the camera's position) and goes in a certain direction. The ray travels through the 3D space.

3. **Intersection Testing:** As the ray travels through the scene, it needs to check if it hits or intersects with any 3D objects (like meshes, bounding boxes, or spheres) in the scene. This is where acceleration structures like BVH, grids, or octrees come into play.

    - In the case of BVH, the scene is organized into a tree-like structure of bounding volumes (often boxes). The ray starts at the root of the tree and moves down, checking which bounding volumes it intersects with.
    
    - In the case of an octree or grid, the 3D space is divided into smaller chunks or cells. The ray checks which cells it intersects with.

4. **Intersection Results:** When an intersection is found, you get information about what the ray hit, such as the object and the point of intersection. This information can be used for various purposes like picking objects, handling collisions, or determining what the ray is pointing at in a 3D scene.

So, while the specific data structure used for acceleration might not always be an octree in three.js, the concept of efficiently checking for intersections in a 3D scene is similar to what octrees do in a broader context. The goal is to reduce the number of objects you need to check for intersections, making raycasting faster and more efficient.
