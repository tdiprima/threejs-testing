  <h1>First, what is a rotation?</h1>
  <p>A rotation, simply put, changes the orientation of an object while maintaining its shape.</p>
  <p>A rotation can occur either on an object or its coordinate frame. These are equal but opposite, and which is
    essentially the difference between picking up a Rubik’s cube and turning which side faces you (object rotation),
    or leaving it on the table and moving around it to change the angle in which you view it (coordinate frame
    rotation).</p>
  <h1>How we represent rotations:</h1>
  <p>There are several mathematical approaches to represent rotations.</p>

  <h2>Euler angles</h2>
  <p>This is based on the principle that any rotation happening in space can be described by using three angles.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the most common of these sequences for pitch, yaw and roll is the aerospace Euler sequence.</p>

  <h2>Quaternions</h2>
  <p>Quaternions can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to the other rotational approaches discussed
    above, and is our preferred approach for defining rotations. This representation uses a complex number with one
    real term and three imaginary terms:</p>
  <p>q = w + xi + yj + zk, where w is a real term, and x, y, z, are the imaginary terms; or a vector representation
    of q = [w,x,y,z] = [w,<strong>a</strong>] where w is a real term and <strong>a</strong> = vector (x,y,z)</p>
  <p>Quaternions eliminate the risk of gimbal lock and are more numerically stable than DCM: there are no redundant
    factors, no (costly) need to orthogonalize over manipulations and it’s easier to maintain normalization.</p>
