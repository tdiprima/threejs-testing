## Create Interactive Grid

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have three.js code that loads an image onto a plane.  Now, I need to draw a grid of lines over the image, and allow the user to click-drag their mouse through the grid, so that each square that they drag their mouse over gets colored in red.  And then I need to be able to save the location information of the colored squares for future use.</span>

To achieve your goal, you will need to modify your existing Three.js code to include the following functionalities:

1. **Create a Grid Over the Image**: You can use a `THREE.GridHelper` or a custom grid of lines for this. However, `THREE.GridHelper` might not align perfectly with your image, so drawing a custom grid might be better.

2. **Detect Mouse Movements**: Use raycasting to detect where the mouse is pointing and highlight the corresponding grid square.

3. **Color the Grid Squares Red**: Modify the color of the grid square where the mouse is dragged.

4. **Save the Location Information**: Store the coordinates of the colored squares for future use.

Here's an extended version of your code that includes these functionalities:

[funky-empress.html](funky-empress.html)

This code sets up the necessary elements and includes the basic logic for detecting mouse movements over the grid. You will need to fill in some specifics, especially for determining the exact grid square based on the face index and for coloring it red. This could involve modifying the geometry or using a secondary overlay mesh.

For saving the colored squares, you can choose a method that suits your application, such as sending the data to a server or storing it locally.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">onmousemove, I get "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "materialIndex", face is null"</span>

The error you're encountering, "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 'materialIndex', face is null", suggests that the `intersect` object sometimes doesn't have a `face` property. This can happen if the raycaster doesn't intersect a face of the mesh. Let's add a check to ensure that `face` is not null before attempting to access its properties.

Additionally, for coloring individual grid squares, we need a more nuanced approach. The `PlaneGeometry` in Three.js doesn't inherently support individual face coloring. One workaround is to create a grid of individual plane geometries, each representing a square in the grid, and then change the material of these individual planes when they are interacted with.

Here's a revised version of the onMouseMove function and additional modifications to handle individual grid square coloring.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The new grid didn't work; I see one white rectangle.</span>

```javascript
// ... [previous setup code]

let gridSquares = []; // Array to hold individual grid squares

function addGrid(geometry) {
  const size = 4, step = 4 / 40; // Assuming 40x40 grid

  for (let i = 0; i < size; i += step) {
    for (let j = 0; j < size; j += step) {
      const squareGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(step, step);
      const squareMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
      const square = new THREE.Mesh(squareGeom, squareMat);
      square.position.set(i - size / 2 + step / 2, 0.01, j - size / 2 + step / 2); // Slightly above the main plane
      scene.add(square);
      gridSquares.push(square);
    }
  }
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(gridSquares);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const intersect = intersects[0];
    const square = intersect.object;

    // Change color of the square to red
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000);

    // Add square position to the coloredSquares array if not already included
    const squarePosition = `${square.position.x},${square.position.z}`;
    if (!coloredSquares.includes(squarePosition)) {
      coloredSquares.push(squarePosition);
    }
  }
}

// ... [rest of your code]
```

This code creates a grid of individual squares (planes) and changes the color of the square that the mouse intersects. The position of each colored square is stored in a format like "x,z" for future use. Adjust the grid size and steps according to your needs.

## Fit to image

To ensure that the grid fits the exact size of the image in your Three.js scene, you should adjust the size and position of the grid based on the dimensions of the image texture. Since the plane geometry is already scaled to match the aspect ratio of the image, you need to apply similar scaling to the grid.

Here's how you can modify the `addGrid` function to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Aspect Ratio:** You have already calculated the aspect ratio of the image when creating the plane. Use this aspect ratio to scale the grid accordingly.

2. **Scale the Grid:** Apply the same scaling to the grid as you did to the plane. This ensures that the grid matches the size of the image.

3. **Position the Grid:** Ensure the grid is correctly positioned to overlay the image. This might involve adjusting the position to align with the plane.

[faithful-squirrel.html](faithful-squirrel.html)

Here is the modified `addGrid` function:

```javascript
function addGrid(plane, aspect) {
  grid.scale.set(1.0, aspect, 1.0); // Scale the grid to match the image aspect ratio
  grid.position.copy(plane.position); // Position the grid to overlay the plane
}
```

And modify the part where you call `addGrid` in your code to pass the `plane` and `aspect`:

```javascript
// Modify the button event listener
addGrid(plane, aspect);
```

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The button event handler had to go inside the TextureLoader callback.</span>

In this updated code:

- The `addGrid` function now takes two parameters: `plane` and `aspect`. It scales and positions the grid based on the plane's size and aspect ratio.
- When you call `addGrid`, make sure to pass the `plane` object and the `aspect` ratio you calculated earlier. This way, the grid will match the size and position of the image.

## GridHelper

GridHelper is not composed of individual segments that can be colored independently.

```js
// faithful-squirrel.html, 9978d7b

function colorGridSquare() {
  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  // Assumes each square is a separate object; for GridHelper, additional work is needed
  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    // Get first intersected object and change its color
    const square = intersects[0].object;
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000); // Set to desired color
  }
}

document.addEventListener('mousedown', colorGridSquare, false);
```
