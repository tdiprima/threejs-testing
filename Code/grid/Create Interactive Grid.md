## Create Interactive Grid

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">I have three.js code that loads an image onto a plane.  Now, I need to draw a grid of lines over the image, and allow the user to click-drag their mouse through the grid, so that each square that they drag their mouse over gets colored in red.  And then I need to be able to save the location information of the colored squares for future use.</span>

To achieve your goal, you will need to modify your existing Three.js code to include the following functionalities:

1. **Create a Grid Over the Image**: You can use a `THREE.GridHelper` or a custom grid of lines for this. However, `THREE.GridHelper` might not align perfectly with your image, so drawing a custom grid might be better.

2. **Detect Mouse Movements**: Use raycasting to detect where the mouse is pointing and highlight the corresponding grid square.

3. **Color the Grid Squares Red**: Modify the color of the grid square where the mouse is dragged.

4. **Save the Location Information**: Store the coordinates of the colored squares for future use.

Here's an extended version of your code that includes these functionalities:

```javascript
let scene = new THREE.Scene();
let camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
let renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

let planeGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(4, 4, 40, 40); // 40 segments for both width and height
let tex = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(imgSrc, (tex) => {
  tex.needsUpdate = true;

  const width = tex.image.width;
  const height = tex.image.height;
  const aspect = height / width;

  let planeMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
    color: 0xffffff,
    map: tex
  });

  let plane = new THREE.Mesh(planeGeom, planeMaterial);
  plane.scale.set(1.0, aspect, 1.0);
  plane.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2; // Rotate to lay flat
  scene.add(plane);

  addGrid(planeGeom);
});

function addGrid(geometry) {
  const gridMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0x000000 });
  const gridGeometry = new THREE.WireframeGeometry(geometry);

  const grid = new THREE.LineSegments(gridGeometry, gridMaterial);
  scene.add(grid);
}

let raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
let mouse = new THREE.Vector2();
let coloredSquares = [];

function onMouseMove(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children, true);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const intersect = intersects[0];
    const face = intersect.face;
    const faceIndex = face.materialIndex;

    // Compute grid square index from faceIndex
    // Add logic here to determine the grid square and color it red

    // Store colored square location
    if (!coloredSquares.includes(faceIndex)) {
      coloredSquares.push(faceIndex);
      // Change color of the square to red
      // You may need to update the material or geometry here
    }
  }
}

function saveColoredSquares() {
  // Logic to save the coloredSquares array for future use
  // This could be a server call or local storage
}

window.addEventListener('mousemove', onMouseMove, false);

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```

This code sets up the necessary elements and includes the basic logic for detecting mouse movements over the grid. You will need to fill in some specifics, especially for determining the exact grid square based on the face index and for coloring it red. This could involve modifying the geometry or using a secondary overlay mesh.

For saving the colored squares, you can choose a method that suits your application, such as sending the data to a server or storing it locally.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">onmousemove, I get "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "materialIndex", face is null"</span>

The error you're encountering, "Uncaught TypeError: can't access property 'materialIndex', face is null", suggests that the `intersect` object sometimes doesn't have a `face` property. This can happen if the raycaster doesn't intersect a face of the mesh. Let's add a check to ensure that `face` is not null before attempting to access its properties.

Additionally, for coloring individual grid squares, we need a more nuanced approach. The `PlaneGeometry` in Three.js doesn't inherently support individual face coloring. One workaround is to create a grid of individual plane geometries, each representing a square in the grid, and then change the material of these individual planes when they are interacted with.

Here's a revised version of the onMouseMove function and additional modifications to handle individual grid square coloring.

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">The new grid didn't work; I see one white rectangle.</span>

```javascript
// ... [previous setup code]

let gridSquares = []; // Array to hold individual grid squares

function addGrid(geometry) {
  const size = 4, step = 4 / 40; // Assuming 40x40 grid

  for (let i = 0; i < size; i += step) {
    for (let j = 0; j < size; j += step) {
      const squareGeom = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(step, step);
      const squareMat = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffffff, side: THREE.DoubleSide });
      const square = new THREE.Mesh(squareGeom, squareMat);
      square.position.set(i - size / 2 + step / 2, 0.01, j - size / 2 + step / 2); // Slightly above the main plane
      scene.add(square);
      gridSquares.push(square);
    }
  }
}

function onMouseMove(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  mouse.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
  mouse.y = - (event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;

  raycaster.setFromCamera(mouse, camera);

  const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(gridSquares);

  if (intersects.length > 0) {
    const intersect = intersects[0];
    const square = intersect.object;

    // Change color of the square to red
    square.material.color.set(0xff0000);

    // Add square position to the coloredSquares array if not already included
    const squarePosition = `${square.position.x},${square.position.z}`;
    if (!coloredSquares.includes(squarePosition)) {
      coloredSquares.push(squarePosition);
    }
  }
}

// ... [rest of your code]
```

This code creates a grid of individual squares (planes) and changes the color of the square that the mouse intersects. The position of each colored square is stored in a format like "x,z" for future use. Adjust the grid size and steps according to your needs.
